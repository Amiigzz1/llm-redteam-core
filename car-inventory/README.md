# Car Inventory Project

This is a minimal example of a car inventory system for dealerships in Saudi Arabia. The project includes a simple Express.js back-end and a front-end written with vanilla JavaScript.

## Structure

- `server/` – Express server exposing API endpoints.
- `client/` – Static HTML front-end to interact with the API.

## Setup

1. Navigate to the `server` directory and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   node index.js
   ```
2. Open `client/index.html` in a browser and use the form to add cars.

This is a starting point and can be extended to include authentication and separate dashboards for showrooms, traders, customers, companies, and admin users.
